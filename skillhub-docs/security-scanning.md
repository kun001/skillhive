# Skill Scanner Backend Runtime Guide

## Overview

SkillHub now supports a backend-only security scanning chain around `skill-scanner`.
The publish flow changes are:

1. publish request enters `SkillPublishService`
2. if scanner is enabled, the version moves to `SCANNING`
3. the backend enqueues a `ScanTask`
4. `ScanTaskConsumer` calls `skill-scanner`
5. the scan result is stored in `security_audit`
6. the version moves to `PENDING_REVIEW`, or to `SCAN_FAILED` after final retry exhaustion
7. review still happens through the existing review workflow

Frontend is intentionally out of scope here. The frontend should fetch audit details through the dedicated backend API instead of expecting scanner data inside existing review detail payloads.

## Runtime Modes

Two runtime modes are supported:

- `local`
  Use `POST /scan` and pass a filesystem path. This only works when SkillHub and `skill-scanner` can see the same files.
- `upload`
  Use `POST /scan-upload` and upload the package archive. This is the safer default for split deployments.

Recommended usage:

- local development with shared filesystem: `local`
- Kubernetes or any split-service deployment: `upload`

## Backend Configuration

Application properties:

```yaml
skillhub:
  security:
    scanner:
      enabled: false
      base-url: http://localhost:8000
      health-path: /health
      scan-path: /scan-upload
      mode: local
      connect-timeout-ms: 5000
      read-timeout-ms: 900000
      retry-max-attempts: 3
    stream:
      key: skillhub:scan:requests
      group: skillhub-scanners
      reclaim-min-idle: PT16M
      max-unavailable-age: PT1H
```

Important environment variables:

- `SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_ENABLED`
- `SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_URL`
- `SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_MODE`
- `SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_READ_TIMEOUT`
- `SKILLHUB_SCAN_STREAM_KEY`
- `SKILLHUB_SCAN_STREAM_GROUP`
- `SKILLHUB_SCAN_STREAM_RECLAIM_MIN_IDLE`
- `SKILLHUB_SECURITY_STREAM_MAX_UNAVAILABLE_AGE`

Scanner-side optional environment variables:

- `SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_API_KEY`
- `SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_BASE_URL`
- `SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_MODEL`
- `SKILLHUB_SCANNER_MAX_CONCURRENT_SCANS` (default `1`)
- `SKILLHUB_SCANNER_HARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `930`)

If the LLM variables are absent, the scanner should still run with non-LLM analyzers.
The default timeout ordering is server read timeout (900 seconds), scanner hard timeout
(930 seconds), then pending-message reclaim (960 seconds). A hard timeout exits the scanner process
with status `124`; Compose or Kubernetes restarts it and the Redis pending task is retried.

## Kubernetes Notes

Current repository manifests assume **separate** `skillhub-server` and `skillhub-scanner` deployments.
Because these deployments do not share a writable package directory, Kubernetes should use:

```text
SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_MODE=upload
SKILLHUB_SECURITY_SCANNER_URL=http://skillhub-scanner:8000
```

Relevant manifests:

- `deploy/k8s/scanner-deployment.yaml`
- `deploy/k8s/services.yaml`
- `deploy/k8s/backend-deployment.yaml`
- `deploy/k8s/configmap.yaml`

The scanner service is internal-only by default and is consumed by the backend through cluster DNS.

## Verification

Verify the scanner service itself:

```bash
sh scripts/verify-scanner.sh http://localhost:8000
sh scripts/verify-scanner.sh http://localhost:8000 /path/to/skill.zip
```

Recommended backend checks after enabling the feature:

1. publish a test package
2. confirm the version status becomes `SCANNING`
3. confirm a `security_audit` row is created
4. confirm the version eventually moves to `PENDING_REVIEW` or `SCAN_FAILED`
5. call `GET /api/v1/skills/{skillId}/versions/{versionId}/security-audit`

## Audit Query API

Backend audit data is available from:

```text
GET /api/v1/skills/{skillId}/versions/{versionId}/security-audit
```

Response fields include:

- `scanId`
- `scannerType`
- `verdict`
- `isSafe`
- `maxSeverity`
- `findingsCount`
- `findings`
- `scanDurationSeconds`
- `scannedAt`
- `createdAt`

## Failure Semantics

- scan task retries are handled by `AbstractStreamConsumer`
- scanner connection failures, HTTP 429, and HTTP 5xx remain pending for automatic recovery
- unavailable tasks older than `max-unavailable-age` are marked `SCAN_FAILED`, acknowledged, and removed from the Redis Stream
- the timeout is evaluated during pending reclaim; terminal handling can occur roughly one `reclaim-min-idle` plus one `reclaim-interval` after the configured age
- terminal failures retain a failure reason in the security audit response for operators and authorized users
- other final failures mark the version as `SCAN_FAILED` after retry exhaustion
- even after scan failure, a review task is still created so the package does not get stuck forever

This keeps the existing human review path intact while making scanner failures visible.
